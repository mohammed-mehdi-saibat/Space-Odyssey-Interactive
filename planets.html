            <h1>SUN</h1>
            <p>
              The Sun is a massive, glowing star at the center of our solar
              system, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. It generates
              energy through nuclear fusion, producing the light and heat that
              sustain life on Earth. The Sun’s warmth drives weather patterns,
              supports plant growth through photosynthesis, and influences the
              orbits of planets and other celestial bodies. As the primary
              source of energy for our planet, the Sun plays a vital role in
              shaping the natural world and maintaining the delicate balance of
              life.

            <h1>MERCURY</h1>
            <p>
              Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest
              to the Sun. It has a rocky, cratered surface that resembles our
              Moon, shaped by billions of years of meteor impacts. Due to its
              proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature
              swings—from scorching heat during the day to freezing cold at
              night. With a very thin atmosphere, it cannot retain heat, making
              its environment harsh and inhospitable. Mercury’s fast orbit and
              unique characteristics provide valuable insights into the
              formation and evolution of rocky planets.

            <p>
              Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called
              Earth’s “sister planet” due to its similar size and composition.
              However, its thick atmosphere, dominated by carbon dioxide,
              creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest
              planet in the solar system. Its surface is covered with volcanic
              plains and towering mountains, hidden beneath dense clouds of
              sulfuric acid. Venus’s extreme temperatures and crushing
              atmospheric pressure make it a hostile environment, yet its
              mysterious nature continues to fascinate scientists and
              astronomers alike.

              an average distance of about 238,900 miles (384,400 kilometers).
              Its rocky surface is covered with craters, mountains, and vast
              plains called maria. The Moon influences Earth’s tides and
              stabilizes its rotation, playing a crucial role in our planet’s
              natural rhythms. As the first celestial body visited by humans,
              the Moon remains a symbol of exploration and wonder.
